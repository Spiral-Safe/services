Nitriding example
=================

This directory contains Hashicorp vault application with Spiral Safe plugin loaded in a Nitro Enclave.  The project's
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile) adds the nitriding standalone executable along with the
enclave application, consisting of the
[Go](backend.go)
and a
[shell script](start.sh)
that invokes nitriding in the background, followed by running the vault and spiral safe plugin.

To build the nitriding executable, the Docker image, the enclave image, and
finally run the enclave image, simply run:

    make
